# IPCDJ Worship — Site Standards

These are protected implementation standards for all future changes to the IPCDJ Worship website.

## Core invariant

Every future change must preserve the existing visual identity, responsive behavior, current-song countdown, calibrated time source, progress bar, automatic phase transitions, automatic Monday rollover, upcoming-song rendering, introduced-song history, pull-to-refresh behavior, PWA behavior, and custom-domain operation unless a change is explicitly requested.

Adding or editing a song must not require manually redesigning or rebuilding the page state. Song lifecycle changes are date-driven from the song pipeline.

## Canonical domain

Primary public URL: https://worship.ipcdj.org/

The GitHub Pages URL remains a technical hosting fallback. Canonical, Open Graph, and other public-facing metadata should use the worship.ipcdj.org hostname.

## Browser and device compatibility

Target current stable versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Samsung Internet, iOS/iPadOS web views and Home Screen web apps, Android browsers/PWAs, macOS, Windows, iPhone, iPad, Android phones/tablets, and normal desktop/laptop viewport sizes.

Use progressive enhancement:
- Start with broadly supported HTML/CSS behavior.
- Advanced CSS must have a usable fallback when unsupported.
- Use both standard and WebKit-prefixed behavior where Safari still requires it.
- Keep viewport-fit=cover and safe-area insets for notched/rounded displays.
- Keep vh fallback before svh/dvh units.
- Preserve portrait and landscape behavior.
- Never rely on hover for required functionality.
- Keep touch targets usable on phones.
- Respect reduced motion, reduced transparency/data where supported, increased contrast, and forced-colors/high-contrast environments.

## Native browser functionality

All user-visible song names, artists, dates, statuses and page copy must remain normal selectable DOM text. Do not convert meaningful page text into canvas, background images, inaccessible SVG-only text, or closed Shadow DOM.

This preserves normal browser features such as:
- Find on Page / Ctrl+F / Command+F
- text selection and copy
- browser zoom
- Reader/accessibility tooling where applicable
- screen-reader text access
- built-in translation/search behavior

Do not use content-visibility, display:none, or other optimization techniques on active user-visible song content if they could make browser text search unreliable.

## Accessibility and input

- Keep semantic HTML structure.
- Preserve keyboard navigation and visible focus.
- Do not announce the live seconds counter every second to screen readers.
- Expose progress through ARIA progressbar values as well as visually.
- Do not encode important status only by color; retain text/borders/dots/pills.
- Do not globally disable text selection or browser zoom.

## PWA and icons

- Keep web manifest, service worker, Apple Home Screen metadata and browser favicons working independently.
- Preserve the supplied CDJ Worship favicon artwork.
- Mobile launcher icons must retain adequate safe-zone padding for platform masking.
- Installed-app changes must use versioned assets/cache updates when needed.

## Refresh and caching

Pull-to-refresh must seek the newest deployed version quickly without destroying the last known-good page first.

Rules:
- Navigation is network-first.
- Never erase the only working offline/app-shell copy before a new response succeeds.
- Service worker updates must be versioned.
- Refresh UI remains centered, crisp and visible long enough to communicate activity.
- Network failure must fall back safely rather than produce a blank/black page.

## Phase-aware progress color system

The progress bar is time-driven and phase-aware. It must continuously inherit its visual state from each song's own pipeline dates rather than hard-coded calendar dates.

Required color semantics:
- Early/active learning uses the existing green progress language.
- Learning matures toward a brighter green.
- Transition into final preparation moves smoothly toward IPCDJ blue.
- Final preparation remains in the blue family.
- The last stretch before estreno transitions from blue toward the established estreno red.
- Estreno resolves to the established red state.
- Color changes must be gradual, repeatable for every future song, and derived from activeFrom, learningStart/end, finalStart/end and releaseAt.
- Important phase meaning must still be conveyed by text/ARIA and not by color alone.
- Reduced-motion users must not receive unnecessary animated transitions.
- Future song additions must inherit this behavior automatically without per-song styling.

## Countdown timing integrity

The countdown is an absolute-time system, not a decrementing counter.

Required rules:
- Never implement the countdown by subtracting one second from a stored value.
- Every displayed value must be recalculated from the absolute estreno timestamp minus calibrated current time.
- Delayed JavaScript callbacks, background-tab throttling, device sleep, refreshes, or dropped frames must never accumulate countdown drift.
- Preserve a short-lived calibrated time seed through same-tab refresh/navigation so the timer resumes immediately instead of visually restarting from an older value.
- Recalibrate against the live server clock in the background without blocking countdown rendering.
- Small sub-second backward corrections from low-precision HTTP Date headers must not make the countdown visibly pause or gain time.
- Returning from the background/pageshow must immediately recalculate from absolute time.

## Song automation

For each scheduled song, keep one pipeline record containing the title, artist, learning period, final-preparation period, estreno time and rollover time.

The website must automatically:
1. Render the correct current song.
2. Run the calibrated countdown.
3. Advance the progress bar with real elapsed time.
4. Highlight the correct phase.
5. Move the completed song into Introducciones recientes with its introduction date.
6. Promote the next song without manual intervention.
7. Preserve chronological introduced-song ordering.
8. Continue expanding vertically as additional songs accumulate.

## Change procedure

Before substantial changes:
1. Fetch the current file/version.
2. Create a backup branch when practical.
3. Make the smallest compatible change.
4. Do not overwrite unrelated current functionality.
5. Verify countdown/pipeline/refresh/PWA/mobile behavior still exists after the change.
6. Bump service-worker/app-shell cache only when deployment freshness requires it.

The visual aesthetic is a protected system: dark blue/black animated background, blue identity accents, green progress/completed states, red estreno states, white estreno text, glass cards, responsive typography and existing spacing/radius hierarchy.
